         <p>A <span style="background-color:powderblue;"> question is a question,</span> anybody can know that a question is a question and so why add to it 
           the question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing. 
           Therefore I never could bring myself to use a <span style="background-color:powderblue;"> question mark,</span> I always found it positively revolting,
            and now very few do use it. Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks,
             they are unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use,
              if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a <span style="background-color:powderblue;"> question. </span> </p>

        As I say <span style="background-color:rgb(179, 205, 171);"> commas </span> servile and they have no life of their own, 
        and their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing oneâ€™s own interest and I do decidedly like to like my own interest 
        my own interest in what I am doing. A <span style="background-color:rgb(179, 205, 171);">comma</span> by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your 
        shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to me for many years and I still do feel that way
         about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them,
         the use of them was positively degrading. Let me tell you what I feel and what I mean and what I felt and what I meant.
       </p>

      <section id="section3">
       <p>
        There are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons you can think of them as commas and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them 
        as periods and then using them can make you feel adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself never have,
         I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma and commas are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience 
         and they are put there just for practical purposes. <span style="background-color:rgb(238, 230, 141);">Semi-colons</span> and colons had for me from the first completely this character the character 
         that a comma has and not the character that a period has and therefore and definitely I have never used them.
       </p>

      <section id="section4">
       <p>
        <span style="background-color:rgb(249, 179, 127);">Periods</span> have a life of their own a necessity of their own a feeling of their own a time of their own. 
        And that feeling that life that necessity that time can express itself in an infinite variety that is the reason that I have always remained true to  <span style="background-color:rgb(249, 179, 127);">periods </span>
        so much so that as I say recently I have felt that one could need them more than one had ever needed them.
        You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a comma, a colon or a semi-colon.

      <section id="section5">
       <p>
        One other little<span style="background-color:rgb(193, 156, 244);"> punctuation</span> mark one can have feelings about and that is the apostrophe for possession.
        Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender
         insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it. One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do, 
         but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case. 
         I absolutely do not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret, there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and its s well perhaps, 
         perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness.
